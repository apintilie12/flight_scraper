# flight_scraper
Simple flight related web scraper using Python
The program scrapes the website of CLJ airport to find the next arriving flight (keeping in mind status notes like DELAYED of CANCELLED) and then displays this information nicely formatted on an INKY PHAT (e-Ink display) attached to a Raspberry Pi Zero.
It is used as a service.
